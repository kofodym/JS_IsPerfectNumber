// A JavaScript function that checks whether a number is perfect.

//  Cond1: A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, excluding the number itself
//  cond 2: Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).

// 1: Collect an input no from user
// Initialize a variable to store the total of the correct positive divisors to be 0
// Keep track of all divisors from 1 to number/2,
// If number is sum of all divisors.

function perfect_number(number) {}

console.log(perfect_number(20));
